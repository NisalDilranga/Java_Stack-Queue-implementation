# Java_Stack-Queue-implementation
Stack and Queue Implementations in Java This repository contains Java implementations of the stack and queue data structures. These implementations provide basic functionalities such as push/pop for stacks and enqueue/dequeue for queues, along with methods to check for fullness and emptiness.
Stack Implementation:
The Stack class provides a simple implementation of a stack data structure using an array. It includes methods for pushing elements onto the stack (push), popping elements from the stack (pop), peeking at the top element without removing it (peek), and checking if the stack is empty (isEmpty) or full (isFull).

Queue Implementation:
The Queue class offers a straightforward implementation of a queue data structure using an array. It features methods for enqueueing elements into the queue (enQueue), dequeuing elements from the queue (deQueue), and checking if the queue is empty (isEmpty) or full (isFull).
